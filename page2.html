<p> <li>What distinguishes normal HTML elements from semantic HTML elements
    <div>Normal HTML elements: div tag and span tag _ Simply performs inline task and divide(block) task respectively without showing any content. while
        semantic elements: form,table,and article tags - displays their content. </div>

    <p><li>Explain the disparity between closing tags and self-closing tags in HTML</li> </p>
    <div>In HTML, almost all tags have both an opening and closing tag <br>e.g, div tag; the closing tag always has a forward slash before the tag name that you are closing. However, there are special instances in HTML called “self-closing tags”, or tags that don’t require both an opening and closing tag before another tag can start.</div>

    <P>
        <li> What distinguishes inline elements from block elements in HTML?</li></P>
    
        <div>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available while an inline element does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary. The div tag is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements.</div>
